Just some notes for myself regarding this project.

So, I was able to understand a few more things today. They are about

a) NCBI taxonomy database: The files associated with this entity arewithin the ExternalContent\taxdump folder. SQL scripts are used to
		load information from these files into the certain tables (in MySQL), which will be used at program runtime. Run the SQL scripts
		before beginning a job in order to use them in the program.
		
b) blast Database: This database is accessed at the beginning of a job, where the blast executables (located in ExternalContent\blast folder) 
		use this files. Currently, it is called "nr".

c) Query protein sequence: This is referred to as 'infile' by the program. It is passed as a blast parameter. This file is uploaded by the user
		while submitting a job. The location to this is available in the 'orders' table.
		
The output from the blast module is written to the file referred to by BlastXMLOutput in al.ali.main.Interface.java file. This is passed as
a parameter to processBlastOutput method in the al.ali.blast.localBlast.java class file. The output file as a result of the AlienG algorithm
is written to files: 'outfile.txt', and 'only_group1_outfile.txt'. However, I have modified this today as 'Apil_Job_outfile.txt', and 
'Apil_Job_only_group1_outfile.txt'.

Tinker around with the interface part, and see if you can wire up the components together to run a complete job!
